							Why we built the Content Marketing Examples Database:
						</h3>
						<p>Our team shares great content examples with each other every day in Slack, Twitter, and elsewhere. We also analyze tons of content marketing projects every year to see what's working. Over the years, we’ve spotted some awesome projects, but it was always hard to reference those projects – and why we liked them – without shuffling through emails and private messages.</p>
						<p>We built the Content Marketing Examples Database to solve that problem for ourselves, our clients, and the content marketing community. Need a great example of a data visualization project that helps with conversion? We might just have that here, and we’re adding more all of the time.</p>
						<p>We love seeing what our content marketing peers are releasing every month, and we love sharing a few of the projects we’ve done with clients, too. In that spirit, we’d love for you to share what you’ve been working on!</p>

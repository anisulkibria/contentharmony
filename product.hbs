	              <p><strong>⭐ What exactly is Content Harmony?</strong></p>
	              <p>Content Harmony is a tool for SEOs, content marketers, and writers to analyze content topics in-depth, and share notes as part of the process of creating a content brief. We research in one place that used to take hours, and make sure everyone
	                on your team is seeing the same factors that should be influencing the content you create, like topics, keywords, entities, image and video usage, questions to answer, and other key elements that should show up in your content.</p>
	              <p>We’re like your current content brief, but faster, standardized, and repeatable.</p>
								<hr class="small">
								<p><strong>⭐ How can I try it out?</strong></p>
	              <p>Right now! Sign up for your <a href="{{@site.url}}/sign-up/">first 10 briefs for just $10</a>, or <a href="{{@site.url}}/demo/">schedule a demo</a> and we'll give you the same access for free.</p>
								<hr class="small">
	              <p><strong>⭐ How is this different from keyword research tools like SEMRush, Ahrefs, and Moz?</strong></p>
	              <p>Most keyword research tools are focused on helping you find hundreds or thousands of keywords you might want to target.</p>
	              <p>Which is awesome, but what about when you need to analyze a single keyword with a magnifying glass?</p>
	              <p>Our software is built for just that – analyzing the heck out of one single keyword at a time. We tell you everything from top keywords and entities that need to show up in your content, to what questions consumers are asking about that topic.</p>
								<p>Our goal isn’t to give you tons of ideas for new content on your site – it’s to give you the data you need to produce a single piece of content <em>really well</em>, and then communicate that with writers and clients.</p>
	              <hr class="small">
								<p><strong>⭐ How is this different from traditional page graders?</strong></p>
	              <p>Most page graders (like the kind you add as a WordPress plugin) scan your content for a single keyword and tell you where you can use it. It’s an OK tool for very basic keyword analysis, but it breaks down quickly once you get into a competitive
	                topic where a few exact match keyword usages isn’t going to help you compete.</p>
	              <p>We go out and actually scan the search results for the keyword you want to rank for, making over 100 API calls and analyzing dozens of pages of content to understand exactly what Google is currently ranking for that phrase. We look at raw
	                keyword analysis, “smart” keywords and entities from services like IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding AI, and we even make smart customized recommendations like internal linking opportunities for your domain.</p>
	              <p>What you end up with is a roadmap for components that need to show up in your content if you want to compete – not just a basic text scan.</p>
	              <hr class="small">
								<p><strong>⭐ Are you building this to be used by content agencies or in-house teams?</strong></p>
	              <p>Both. We’ve built our app structure to support projects (similar to a project management system like Basecamp or Asana).</p>
	              <p>👉 If you’re an agency or freelancer, you can set up one or more projects for each client.</p>
	              <p>👉 If you’re an in-house team, you can use these projects to separate different types of content, such as product pages vs blog posts.</p>
	              <p>We’ll offer unlimited users and unlimited projects regardless of which plan you’re on, so you don’t need to worry about dumb stuff like deciding who gets access on your team or sharing passwords.</p>
	              <hr class="small">
								<p><strong>⭐ Wait, isn’t Content Harmony a marketing agency?</strong></p>
	              <p>We were! Our agency team broke off in 2020 after our official software launch. Content Harmony is purely a software company now, aside from helping customers with <a href="{{@site.url}}/services/managed-briefs/">managed content briefs</a> and <a href="{{@site.url}}/services/training/">content marketing training</a>.</p>
	              <p>Most importantly for our customers – our software is a completely separate company from that agency team – which means separate terms of services and complete data privacy for software users.</p>
	              <hr class="small">
								<p><strong>⭐ What’s the difference between a keyword brief, a content brief, and a creative brief?</strong></p>
	              <p>To be honest, we often use them synonymously, but here’s how we think about them:</p>
	              <ul>
	                <li><strong>Keyword Report</strong> – this is the term we use to talk about the keyword insights that Content Harmony uncovers in our reports.</li>
	                <li><strong>Content Brief</strong> – the next step after reviewing a keyword report is to add your notes on how to produce that content – that’s your content brief.</li>
	                <li><strong>Creative Brief</strong> – generally accepted term across many marketing and creative disciplines for a 1-2 page description of creative work that needs to be produced. You might produce a creative brief for a video or a full-page
	                  magazine ad. A content brief is a variation of creative brief designed specifically for content marketing requirements.</li>
	              </ul>
	              <p>Within the Content Harmony software, all three of these are usually referring to the same thing – a keyword-driven workflow where you can build a brief with notes and instructions for writers and other content producers.</p>
